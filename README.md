# Influence-Analysis-On-Youtube-Data
A small Python program developed for our Big Data course. I collaborated with Zachary Dean Dussaq to complete the project.

# What does this program do?
Within this code, we were able to navigate through massive amounts of Youtube data from 2007-2008, and analyze the similarities and differences between the two years. It was great to see the results from back then and compare them with current day Youtube statistics. It's safe to say that a lot has changed on Youtube since then.
